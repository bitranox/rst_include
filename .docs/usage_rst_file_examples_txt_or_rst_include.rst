text or RST file include
========================
.. code-block:: bash

    # simple text include, without code setting - it is imported as normal textfile, as it is.
    # You might also include other rst files
    .. include:: include3.py
        :start-line: 0       # working, also end-line, etc ... all others suppressed.
        :number-lines:       # not working without :code: setting
